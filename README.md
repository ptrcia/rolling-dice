--------------------------------------------------
Dice roll simulator for role-playing games.

Developed for mobile, download available in APK format.

It is a small application to simulate dice rolls. Available dice D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20.

You can role them automatically or with the mobile accelerometer, with a ‘shake’. apart from simulating them you can also give the results numerically by disabling the simulation option.
